# Tugas Kecil 1 Strategi Algoritma - 13522073

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/juanaw6/Tucil1_13522073)

This repository contains a Python code that provides a solution finder for a game that is inspired by the breach protocol mini-game found in Cyberpunk 2077. It aims to replicate the hacking mechanic, allowing users to input a grid (matrix) and sequences to find the optimal path for the highest possible reward. The tool supports input through files or direct user input and includes functionality for generating random puzzles and saving solutions.
